            <h1>About us</h1>

            <p>Learning new languages has always intrigued me. The need to communicate with people who don't share my language can often be a barrier to meaningful conversations. As I endeavor to build a diverse network of individuals, I recognize that not everyone may comprehend my native tongue. Consequently, I turned to language learning platforms like Duolingo. However, I found that it didn't fully address all the challenges I faced. This realization led me to create Vocal-Flip, a tool designed to make language learning easier and more accessible, eliminating the hassles associated with communication barriers.</p>
